Before running the app you need to run init_app.py. Do this by entering python3 init_app.py

init_app will require you to entire a bycrypt key and a moderator account

I also needed to use the library PIL in order to resize image. It was a little dificult to install but it should work by entering pip install Pillow in terminal
